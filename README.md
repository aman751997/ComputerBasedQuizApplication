"# ComputerBasedQuizApplication" 
Introduction:->
In this project I coded to develop a small offline computer based test desktop application using the popular and versatile JAVA programming language. 
Core Java Concepts - AWT , Swings and multithreading.
Computer based Test simply refers to tests and assessments conducted through the use of the organized systems on computers. Computer Based tests have the ability to automate a very time consuming task, marking and monitoring progress. 
Reasons for choosing this project:->
A computer based exam system proved to be a revolutionary step in conducting major exams like entrance exams for various universities and organisations/companies. Major reasons for this being the advantage provided to conduct exam on a large scale, ease in preparing the result and many more.
After facing the online examinations like JEE-MAIN, VITEEE, BITSAT conducted on a similar environment . I thought of always out of curiosity wanted to know the logic behind the exam, although it was an online exam build on a similar concept i.e. using JAVA language but as I learned JAVA CORE only in this summer training because course on ADVANCED JAVA was unavailable there. So using CORE JAVA I thought of developing a similar environment and was possible using the concepts of swings and developing a desktop application for the same.
